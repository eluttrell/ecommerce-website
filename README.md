# E-commerce website
This site was built using AngularJS, PostgreSQL, Python/Flask, and of course HTML/CSS/Skeleton grid-system. 

We also implemented bcrypt for hashing and securly storing passwords in the database, as well as uuid for token creation. 
Tokens were saved as cookies on the frontend, and used for user login status verification when viewing items in the shopping cart and finalizing purchases.
We used the Stripe API for taking credit card purchases. 
I got all the functionality I wanted from the site, and am currently in the process of overhauling the front and backends. 
Ultimately it will sell a variety of Chinese teas, as well as listing the health benefits of said teas. 
I also plan to rebuild the backend using NodeJS, and will deploy it via AWS.

Check back soon for updates!

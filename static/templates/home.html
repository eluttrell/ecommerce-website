                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The practice of drinking tea has a long history in China, having originated there. Although tea originated in China, during the Tang Dynasty, Chinese tea generally represents tea leaves which have been processed using methods inherited from ancient China. According to popular legend, tea was discovered by Chinese Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 BCE when a leaf from a nearby shrub fell into water the emperor was boiling. Tea is deeply woven into the history and culture of China. The beverage is considered one of the seven necessities of Chinese life, along with firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce and vinegar. Around 771 BC – 476 BC the Chinese tea is used for medicinal purposes.This period also known as the “Spring and Autumn Period”, it is where Chinese people first enjoyed the juice extracted from the tea leaves that they chewed.</p>
                <p>Throughout China, in restaurants, it is common for customers to clean their bowls and utensils at the table by rinsing them with tea from the pot.</p>

              <h3>Health</h3>
              <p>There are many health benefits attributed to drinking Chinese tea, ranging from feelings of well-being to near magical cures. For Westerners, much of this interest is focused on ancient claims related to weight loss and more modern claims of cancer-prevention due to tea's anti-oxidant properties. Each person must make their own assessment of the facts. While there are centuries of tradition and empirical evidence, there is little modern scientific consensus that supports the health benefits of tea.</p>
              <p>We believe that any food product can have positive and/or negative health effects and in varying degrees for different individuals. We do not recommend teas on the basis of health benefits and at this point, do not think it is prudent to recommend tea-drinking for anything other than to enjoy the wonderful flavour and the joyous experience of enjoying tea alone or with friends.</p>

              <h3>Understanding Your Tastes</h3>
              <p>Let's start with the hardest part, the vocabulary of odors, which helps us describe those characteristics linked to the sense of smell that can be detected both in the dry leaf and the infusion, and also the characteristics of the liquor, perceived by retro-nasal olfaction. Like many professional tasters, we begin with families of odors, rather than the molecules or groups of molecules that create the odors. Our objective in assembling this vocabulary is to define a certain number of the major aromatic "families" encountered in the course of tea tasting. This approach allows us to pass from general sensations to specific ones and fits in well with the way the odors enrich one another. It is important to understand that these families do not stand in isolation and there are no strict barriers between them. So, an iodized note suggesting fish, like that found in Japanese Sencha teas, often also has floral accents of the rose type. The note of hay that can be detected in many dry tea leaves may lead on towards the vanilla and woody groups.</p>
